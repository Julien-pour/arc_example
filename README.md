# ARC Example
For each example, we have included:
- One program that successfully solved the task and one that failed (see the `.py` file).
- A plot displaying the correct input-output grids, alongside the output from the program that failed.

We provide one example for each of the following categories:  
- `solved_by_smaller_models_only`  
- `solved_in_later_generations`  

Feel free to explore additional examples in the `others_examples` directory. These are grouped by categories, such as cases where one model failed while another succeeded, or where the same model failed in one generation but succeeded in a later one.
